# Deep-learning-for-facial-detection-and-recognition

The objective of this project is to utilize three deep learning algorithms (eigenfaces, fisherfaces, and lbph) for the purpose of facial detection and recognition through C++ programming.

As the next step, we will endeavor to enhance this code, leveraging the Python programming language.
